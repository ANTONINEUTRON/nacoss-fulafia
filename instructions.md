## What is SDLC?
SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.

  The following figure is a graphical representation of the various stages of a typical SDLC: ![SDLC](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_stages.jpg) 
A typical Software Development Life Cycle consists of the following stages âˆ’

 - Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
 - Stage 2: Defining Requirements
 - Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture
 - Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product
 - Stage 5: Testing the Product
 - Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance

We will be using a model called **waterfall model**

The **Waterfall Model** was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. It is very simple to understand and use. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.

Waterfall approach was first SDLC Model to be used widely in Software Engineering to ensure success of the project. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

The following illustration is a representation of the different phases of the Waterfall Model: ![waterfall model](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/images/sdlc_waterfall_model.jpg)
