## Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
**Requirement analysis** is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in this phase and documented in a requirement specification document(i.e. this document).

Planning for the quality assurance requirements and identification of the risks associated with the project is also done in the planning stage. The outcome of the technical feasibility study is to define the various technical approaches that can be followed to implement the project successfully with minimum risks.

## Understanding what we are up for
We have access to the site via an [ftp account](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29940/ftp-account); this implies we have a number of limitations such as:
- No access to database
- No access to file explorer 
- In summary if u know what Cpanel is, there's no access to it
